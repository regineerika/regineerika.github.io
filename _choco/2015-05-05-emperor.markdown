Wallace Stevens
Call the roller of big cigars,    
The muscular one, and bid him whip    
In kitchen cups concupiscent curds.    
Let the wenches dawdle in such dress    
As they are used to wear, and let the boys    
Bring flowers in last month's newspapers.    
Let be be finale of seem.    
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.
